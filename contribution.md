# Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Welcome, contributor! This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of our development workflow using Git and GitHub. Following these steps will ensure a smooth and effective process for everyone.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Local Environment

Before you start coding, you need to get the project on your local machine.

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    -   Click the **Fork** button on the top-right of the repository page on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project.
    

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    -   Clone your forked repository to your computer. Replace `[YOUR-USERNAME]` with your actual GitHub username.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR-USERNAME]/[PROJECT-NAME].git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd [PROJECT-NAME]
    ```

## Step 2: Branching Strategy

Always work on a new branch for every contribution. This keeps the `main` branch clean and makes it easier to manage changes.

1.  **Create a New Branch**
    -   Create a branch from the `main` branch and switch to it.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
    ```

2.  **Branch Naming Conventions**
    -   Using a consistent naming convention helps us understand the purpose of a branch at a glance. Please use the following formats:
        -   **Features:** `feat/short-feature-description` (e.g., `feat/add-user-login`)
        -   **Bug Fixes:** `fix/short-bug-description` (e.g., `fix/navbar-alignment-issue`)
        -   **Documentation:** `docs/topic-of-docs` (e.g., `docs/update-contribution-guide`)
        -   **Refactoring:** `refactor/area-of-refactor` (e.g., `refactor/simplify-api-calls`)

## Step 3: Make and Commit Your Changes

This is the core development loop: **code, stage, commit**.

1.  **Make Your Changes**
    -   Write your code, fix the bug, or improve the documentation.

2.  **Check the code with flake8 and black**
    ```bash
    # installation
    pip install flake8 black
    
    # checking code while in the root of the project
    flake8 path_to_file.py
    black path_to_file.py
    ```
    -   Correct any errors if any appear.
    
3.  **Stage Your Changes**
    -   Add the files you've changed to the staging area.
    ```bash
    # Stage all changes
    git add .

    # Or stage a specific file
    git add path/to/your/file.js
    ```

4.  **Commit Your Changes**
    -   Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message that follows the **Conventional Commits** standard.
    -   A good commit message is crucial for understanding the project's history.

    **Commit Message Structure:**
    `type: subject`

    **Examples:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Implement user profile page"
    git commit -m "fix: Resolve off-by-one error in pagination"
    git commit -m "docs: Add details about API endpoints to README"
    ```

## Step 4: Push Changes to Your Fork

Once you've committed your changes, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

1.  **Push the Branch**
    -   The `-u` flag sets the upstream link, so for future pushes from this branch, you can simply use `git push`.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>
    ```

---

## Step 5: Create a Pull Request (PR)

The final step is to propose your changes to the main project by creating a Pull Request.

1.  Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2.  You will see a prompt to **"Compare & pull request"**. Click it.
3.  **Write a Clear Title and Description:**
    -   The **title** should be concise and follow the conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: Add dark mode toggle`).
    -   The **description** should explain *what* you changed and *why*.
4.  **Link to the Issue:**
    -   If your PR fixes an existing issue, add `Closes #[ISSUE-NUMBER]` to the description. This will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.
5.  Click **"Create pull request"**. A project maintainer will review your work, provide feedback if needed, and merge it once it's approved.
